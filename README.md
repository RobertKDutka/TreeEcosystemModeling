# TreeEcosystemModeling
Trying to replicate/approximate the results from a paper called Synthetic Silviculture: Multi-scale Modeling 
of Plant Ecosystem.

This is currently a work in progress and will take some time to implement fully. Since the paper does not 
contain enough details, some features and parameters will have to be approximated/guessed.

I am working on 2 parts of the project, the tree models and the graphical representation. 
The Vulkan part of the project was just for me to get started in Vulkan and draws a pipe along 
some coordinates. It will be heavily modified later, and possibly swapped out for a different graphic solution.
